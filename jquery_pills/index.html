          <h3>Software development project</h3>
          <p>
            Software development projects are an essential part of any computer
            science or software engineering curriculum. These projects are
            designed to provide students with practical experience in developing
            software from scratch, and to apply the theoretical knowledge gained
            in the classroom to real-world problems. The benefits of software
            development projects are numerous. First and foremost, they provide
            an opportunity for students to work independently and take ownership
            of their work. Students must manage their time effectively and plan
            their work, which helps to develop critical thinking,
            problem-solving, and project management skills. Software development
            projects also provide students with an opportunity to develop
            technical skills in a specific programming language or technology.
            This helps to make students more marketable to potential employers
            upon graduation. Moreover, students get a chance to showcase their
            technical skills and creativity in building innovative solutions to
            real-world problems. Finally, software development projects can also
            be a great way for students to work on projects that are meaningful
            to them. They may choose to work on projects that have a direct
            impact on their community or projects that they are personally
            interested in, making the project more engaging and rewarding. In
            summary, software development projects are an essential component of
            computer science and software engineering education. They provide
            students with practical experience in developing software, develop
            their critical thinking and project management skills, enhance their
            technical skills, and allow them to work on meaningful projects.

          <h3>Engineering design and innovation</h3>

          <p>
            "Engineering design and innovation" is a group project that is
            typically undertaken by engineering students each semester. The main
            objective of this project is to provide students with practical
            hands-on experience in designing and developing engineering
            solutions to real-world problems. Through this project, students
            learn the importance of teamwork, problem-solving, communication,
            and project management. They work together in groups to identify a
            problem, conduct research, analyze data, and design and develop a
            solution. They also learn how to document their work, present their
            findings, and receive feedback from their peers and instructors.
            This project is beneficial for students as it allows them to apply
            the theoretical knowledge they have learned in their coursework to
            real-world problems. It helps them develop the skills and experience
            necessary to succeed as engineers and prepares them for the
            challenges they will face in their future careers. Additionally,
            this project provides students with the opportunity to network and
            build relationships with their peers, instructors, and potential
            employers. It also helps them develop a strong portfolio of work
            that they can showcase to future employers, which can increase their
            chances of finding employment after graduation. Overall, the
            engineering design and innovation project is an important and
            valuable experience for engineering students as it prepares them for
            success in their future careers and provides them with the skills,
            knowledge, and experience necessary to become successful engineers.

          <h3>Design and Thinking</h3>
          <p>
            Design and Thinking (DT) is an approach to problem-solving that
            emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and experimentation. It is a
            methodology that involves identifying a problem, gathering data,
            brainstorming solutions, prototyping, and testing. DT is used in a
            wide range of fields, from product design to social innovation, and
            is often employed in interdisciplinary teams. The paper publishing
            component of DT is an important aspect of the course as it helps
            students develop skills in academic writing and research. By
            reflecting on their EDI project and the design process they went
            through, students can develop a deeper understanding of the problem
            they were trying to solve, the design choices they made, and the
            impact of their solution. Publishing their work also helps students
            build a portfolio of their projects and accomplishments, which can
            be valuable when applying for jobs or further education. Moreover,
            publishing a paper in a peer-reviewed journal or presenting it at a
            conference can also help students gain recognition within their
            field and contribute to the larger body of knowledge in the area of
            design and innovation. It also provides an opportunity to receive
            feedback and constructive criticism from experts in the field, which
            can help students refine their ideas and approach to
            problem-solving. Overall, the paper publishing component of DT is a
            valuable exercise in critical thinking, communication, and academic
            writing, and it provides students with an opportunity to showcase
            their design skills and contribute to the field of design and
            innovation.

          <h3>Course project</h3>
          <p>
            Course projects are an important component of any academic program.
            They provide students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge
            and skills they have learned in a particular course to a real-world
            problem or situation. This can help students to gain a deeper
            understanding of the subject matter, as well as develop important
            critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In addition, course
            projects can help students to develop important career-related
            skills, such as project management, teamwork, and communication.
            These skills are highly valued by employers and can give students a
            competitive advantage in the job market. Course projects can also be
            a way for students to explore their own interests and passions
            within a particular subject area. By choosing a project topic that
            is meaningful to them, students are more likely to be engaged and
            motivated in their work. Overall, course projects are an important
            and valuable component of any academic program. They provide
            students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills in
            a meaningful way, develop important career-related skills, and
            explore their own interests and passions within a particular subject
            area.
